n 1992, Urban M端ller, a Swiss physics student, took over a small online archive for Amiga software.[2] The archive grew more popular, and was soon mirrored around the world. Today, it is the world's largest Amiga archive, known as Aminet.

M端ller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing the smallest possible compiler,[3] inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the FALSE programming language.[4] M端ller's original compiler was implemented in machine language and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes. He uploaded the first Brainfuck compiler to Aminet in 1993. The program came with a "Readme" file, which briefly described the language, and challenged the reader "Who can program anything useful with it? :)". M端ller also included an interpreter and some quite elaborate examples. A second version of the compiler used only 240 bytes.[5] There are currently many brainfuck compilers in the web.

As Aminet grew, the compiler became popular among the Amiga community, and in time it was implemented for other platforms.
